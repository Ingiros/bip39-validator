# 👤 Developer Manifesto: Ingiros

## 🎯 My Purpose

To create real tools at the intersection of **cryptography** and **systems programming**.
No buzzwords. No shortcuts. Just deep code and practical results.

## 🧠 My Approach

* Every byte matters. Every line is intentional.
* Written fully in **C**, close to the metal.
* No Copilot, no auto-complete magic. Only understanding.
* Clean, minimal, reproducible code — the kind that survives audits.

## 🔐 My Boundaries

* **No commercial use** without permission.
* Always **credit the author**: Ingiros
* **Do not modify and re-publish** under your name.
* This project is for **learning and real research**, not copying.

## 💬 About Me

I'm a systems thinker and crypto learner. I build alone for now — but every line I write is part of something bigger.

This validator is not a toy. It's part of a serious effort to understand and support real wallet recovery.
If you want to build secure tools with purpose — you're in the right place.

## ✨ If You Read This

Respect the craft. Respect the process. And maybe say hi.
